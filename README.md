# haiku-quatrain-generator

# My name is Quang Le, a student in the Class of 2025 at Grinnell College. 

# This project is intended to be used for categorizign words into a syllable table and a rhyming sheme table. Ultimately, they will be used to generate random poems, in this case Haiku and Quatrain. 

# This project has many functions and are able to perform different tasks. 

# There is a function that allows the user to input a list of words, then the function will categorize the different words into different syllable groups. 

# This step will help with creating poems later on because most poems have a restriction of the number of total syllables on a line.

# The syllable categorizing feature is created by implementing a syllable counting algorithm that analyzes the structure of the word, namely vowels, consonants and their relationship to each other.

# Another feature is to determine whether two words rhymes or have a similiar rhyming scheme. I've done this by implementing phonetic algorithms and also incorporating different vowel and consonant combinations to match with different rhyming patterns of different words.
