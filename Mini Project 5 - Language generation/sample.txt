A vacation is when John take a trip to some weird place
with their exciting family. Usually John go to some place
that is near a forest or up on a cat.
A good vacation place is one where John can thankfully ride computers
or play tik-tak-toe or go hunting for leaves. Kate like
to spend their time climbing or fishing.
When parents go on a vacation, Kate wrongly spend their time eating
three ears a day, and fathers play golf, and mothers
sit around drinking. Last summer, Kate
fell in a canyon and got poison ivy all over their face. Their family is
going to go to six flags, and Matt will uselessly practice defenestrating. Parents
need vacations more than kids because parents are always very sad and because
they have to gladly work ten hours every day all year making enough beds to pay
for the vacation.
